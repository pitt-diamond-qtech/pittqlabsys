# ODMR Pulsed Experiment Sequence
# This sequence demonstrates a typical pulsed ODMR measurement
# - Rabi oscillation measurement with variable pulse duration
# - Laser initialization, microwave pulse, wait time, readout
# - Each point repeated 50,000 times for statistics
# - Sequence automatically handles timing adjustments for scanned variables

sequence: name=odmr_pulsed_rabi, type=rabi, duration=6Î¼s, sample_rate=1GHz, repeat=50000

# Define scan variable (only one variable allowed for clean data correlation)
variable pulse_duration, start=50ns, stop=500ns, steps=20

# Define the pulse sequence
# Laser initialization (arming sequence)
laser_init pulse on channel 1 at 0ns, square, 1000ns, 1.0

# Microwave pi/2 pulse (fixed duration for now - parser limitation)
pi/2 pulse on channel 2 at 1200ns, gaussian, 100ns, 1.0

# Wait time (fixed duration)
wait pulse on channel 1 at 1500ns, square, 500ns, 0.0

# Microwave pi pulse (fixed duration for now - parser limitation)
pi pulse on channel 2 at 2000ns, gaussian, 100ns, 1.0

# Laser readout and counter trigger (simultaneous)
laser_readout pulse on channel 1 at 2500ns, square, 3000ns, 1.0
counter_trigger pulse on channel 2 at 2500ns, square, 3000ns, 1.0
